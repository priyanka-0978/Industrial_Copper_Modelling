**Introduction**

The Industrial Copper Modelling project focuses on utilising machine learning regression and classification algorithms to predict the selling price and status (won or lost) in the industrial copper market. We intend to construct models that can precisely anticipate the selling price and status in the copper market through dataset exploration, data cleaning and preprocessing, and application of various machine learning techniques.

**Libraries used:**

NumPy: A library for numerical computations in Python.

Pandas: A library for data manipulation and analysis.

Scikit-learn: A machine learning library that provides various regression and classification algorithms.

Matplotlib: A plotting library for creating visualizations.

Seaborn: A data visualization library built on top of Matplotlib.

**Approach:**

Investigating skewness and outliers in the dataset .

Transforming the data into the proper format and carrying out any required cleaning and pre-processing procedures.

Making use of ML regression models such as decision tree regressor, random forest regressor, and gradient boosting regressor to create a machine learning regression model that predicts the continuous variable selling price.

Making use of machine learning classification model such as logistic regression, decision tree clasifier, random forest classifier, and gradient boosting classifier that predicts whether a status is won or lost.

Constructing a Streamlit page where you can input each column data to obtain the anticipated value for the selling_price or the status (won/lost).
